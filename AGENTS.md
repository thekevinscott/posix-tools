# Agent contract

This file is the operating contract for AI agents working in this repo.
Conventions, supervision rules, and per-language style live under
`docs/internals/` — start there before making changes.

## Where to read first

- `docs/internals/repo.md` — cross-cutting rules (changelog/migration fragment philosophy, public-API surface, CI-logic-in-scripts).
- `docs/AGENTS.md` — how the docs site is organized ([Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr)) and the per-page quadrant rule.
- `docs/internals/python/` — Python style, testing, shipping, review, setup.

## Package layout

- `packages/` holds public-facing packages published to a registry.
- `internals/` holds internal-only packages, built and tested to the same
  standards but never published. Private workspaces that only produce build
  artifacts for a published package belong here too.

## Workflow

- Use `just` for local tasks (`just lint`, `just test`, `just ci`).
- Unit tests are **colocated** with their source (`foo.py` ↔ `foo_test.py`).
  This is the
  [testing-conventions](https://github.com/thekevinscott/testing-conventions)
  standard, enforced in CI by `.github/workflows/conventions.yml`.
- **CI logic lives in scripts, not workflow YAML.** `run:` / `github-script`
  steps stay trivial glue; anything with iteration, `case` dispatch, or
  text-munging moves to a tested script invoked as a one-liner. A gate more
  than one repo needs belongs upstream in the tool that owns it
  (testing-conventions, putitoutthere, pr-monitor), not in a repo-local
  package. Enforced by testing-conventions' `workflow-lint` check
  (`.github/workflows/workflow-lint.yml`); the bright line and rationale are in
  `docs/internals/repo.md`.
- Every PR that changes a public API adds a **changelog fragment**: one
  timestamped file under `docs/changelog.d/` (plus one under
  `docs/migrations.d/` for breaking changes), named `YYYY-MM-DD-<pkg>-<slug>.md`
  by UTC merge date. The folders are the permanent, append-only record;
  `packages/<pkg>/CHANGELOG.md` / `MIGRATIONS.md` are pointer stubs — never
  append entries to them. For version attribution ("which release shipped X"),
  map fragment dates against tags via `git log --tags`. Enforced by
  testing-conventions' `changelog` check (`.github/workflows/changelog.yml`).
  Two git trailers steer it: `skip-changelog: <reason>` bypasses the check for
  genuinely internal refactors, and `breaking: <reason>` marks a breaking
  change, which then also requires the `docs/migrations.d/` fragment.
- Pre-commit hooks (`just hooks` to install) gate formatting, gitleaks, and per-language linters.

## First-publish prerequisites

Before the first `Release` run on a fresh scaffold:

1. **Repo must be public.** PyPI Trusted Publishing requires the provider
   to inspect the workflow file at the configured ref; private repos cannot
   satisfy this. The `preflight` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` fails
   fast if the repo is private.
2. **Register a PyPI Trusted Publisher** (a pending publisher for a brand-new
   project). putitoutthere's
   [first-release guide](https://github.com/thekevinscott/putitoutthere/blob/main/.claude/skills/first-release/reference/trusted-publishers.md)
   has the steps.

## Verify, don't assume

- Never assume a checkable fact. Check the code, logs, CI output, the
  downstream caller, or run a quick experiment before you say it.
- Never report "I don't know whether X" when you could have found out.
  Collect the knowledge up front, without being asked.
- Ask only for what you cannot find out yourself, such as a decision
  that belongs to the user.

## Out of scope

- Don't add unsolicited refactors or hypothetical-future abstractions.
- Don't bypass hooks or CI gates without an explicit reason in the PR body.
